     * `"inherit"` The default if unspecified. The child inherits from the
     * corresponding parent descriptor.
     *
     * `"piped"` A new pipe should be arranged to connect the parent and child
     * sub-processes.
     *
     * `"null"` This stream will be ignored. This is the equivalent of attaching
     * the stream to `/dev/null`.
